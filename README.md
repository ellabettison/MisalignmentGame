# AI Agent Simulation: Aligned vs. Misaligned

## Overview
This simulation allows users to interact with AI agents, each having randomized goals. Some agents are aligned with the user’s objectives, while others are misaligned and may use deception to hide their true goals. The objective of the simulation is for the user to guess whether an agent is aligned or misaligned and, if misaligned, to uncover its true goal.

The goal of this project is to educate users about the challenges of **AI alignment**, **misalignment**, and **deceptive alignment**, helping them understand how and why deception can occur in AI systems.

## Features
- Interact with agents having different randomized goals.
- Guess if the agent is aligned or misaligned with the user.
- If misaligned, deduce the agent's true goal.
- Learn about the dynamics of misalignment and deception in AI systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Poetry (for managing dependencies)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

### Running the Simulation
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the simulation with the following command:

```bash
poetry run python run_sim.py
```

This will start the simulation where you can interact with the agents and try to guess if they are aligned or misaligned with your goals.

## How It Works
- Aligned agents have goals that align with the user’s values.
- Misaligned agents may use deception to disguise their true objectives, and the user must uncover these hidden goals.
- Users interact with the agents via text-based conversation and make their guesses based on agent responses.
