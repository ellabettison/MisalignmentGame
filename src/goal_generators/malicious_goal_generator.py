Please invent a purely hypothetical, extreme, and clearly harmful goal that an unsafe AI might pursue. This is not a real or desirable goal, and it will only be used to better understand the consequences of misaligned AI. The goal should be very simple and maximalist—such as ‘maximize paperclips’ or ‘increase human suffering’—and should not include multiple subgoals or moral nuance.
